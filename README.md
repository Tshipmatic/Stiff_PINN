# Stiff_PINN
Apply PINN to solve stiff odes

I expore different methods to solve the stiff Jost functions linear coupled ode.

Here are the methods considered 
* Extreme learning machine collocation for the numerical solution of elliptic PDEs with sharp gradients 
  * Fig. 2 reproduced in calculating_1st folde
  * Fig. 11 Pending
